        <h1>About me</h1>
        <P class="p1">Hi, I'm Soo Jin. I'm half Korean and half Dutch. I grew up in South Korea and moved to the
            Netherlands
            when I was 12. I usually spend my summer vacation in South Korea. I hated the highschool experience, so I
            hope this is better. It should be, but you never know. if you see any spelling or grammer errors, tell me
            before it is to late, I will never know cause I can't spell.
        </P>

        <p class="P2">I have many hobbies that I enjoy in my free time. Two of my main interests are knitting and
            crocheting. Although I still have a lot of stitches to learn, I like challenging myself with new projects.
            At
            the moment, I am working on a shawl that apparently takes a life time to finish, but I enjoy seeing the progress.
            In
            the past, I knitted a blanket, and I am now planning to make a sweater as my next project. Besides working
            with
            yarn, I also enjoy painting with watercolors. My paintings are usually more "abstract", wich means blobs of color
            and
            interesting effects created by blending the paint with water or adding salt. Another hobby of mine is watching Disney
            movies and tv shows.
            One of my favorites was Descendants, and when I was younger I especially enjoyed Sofia the First.</p>
