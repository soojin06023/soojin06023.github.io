        <h1>Why did i chose IT?</h1>
        <img class="IT" src="pics/IT.jpeg" alt="it">
        <P class="choice_it">I chose IT because I had an IT course in high school and I really enjoyed it. That
            experience gave me my
            first real introduction to programming and problem-solving with computers, and I discovered that it suited
            me well. IT also feels like the right direction for me because it's the only STEM field I know where I don't
            have to study physics or chemistry, which were subjects I grown to hate.
            Another important reason for my choice is that I'm autistic, and I think IT is a field where that can
            actually be an advantage instead of a disadvantage. I like that the work is often structured and logical,
            and that it allows me to focus deeply on solving problems in my own way. This makes me feel confident that I
            can develop both my technical skills and my career without constantly having to fight against the
            difficulties I sometimes face in other environments.</P>
        <h1>Why did i chose Hz?</h1>
        <img class="hz_logo" src="pics/hz_logo.png" alt="logo">
        <P>I chose HZ mainly because it seemed like a place where I could focus on what I enjoy most, which is coding.
            From what I saw about the program, there wasn't too much extra outside of programming, which made it feel
            like a good fit for me. I also liked that I had the option to specialize in Software Engineering,
            instead of following a broad Computer Science degree where I would have to study many areas that didn't
            interest me as much. Another factor in my choice was the practical side of studying. I didn't want to deal
            with student housing in other cities, which can be stressful, expensive, and complicated. On top of that, I
            didn't want to stay in high school any longer â€” I was ready for something new and more focused on what I
            really want to do. Choosing HZ made it possible for me to move forward in a way that felt more manageable
            and less overwhelming. Altogether, the combination of being able to focus on Software Engineering path,
            avoiding the challenges of moving away, and leaving high school behind made HZ the most logical and
            comfortable choice for me.</P>
