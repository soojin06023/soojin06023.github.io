        <h1>my first feedback</h1>
        <p>The environment and the method that was chosen to provide us with feedback were frustrating at best, as they
            relied on me being very proactive. This I find unfair, because it's mandatory to have at least one feedback
            from
            the TA and three from co-students. But I'm glad that I stayed, because some people managed to find some
            errors i
            missed. I also received feedback on things that I would have ignored otherwise, because they weren't against
            the
            requirements, nor did I want to find out how to fix them. I gathered all the feedback, made a list of it,
            and
            separated it into three categories: one for taste, one for vague feedback, and one with the highest priority
            to
            implement. like you can see down here.</p>
