    <h1>my first feedback</h1>
    <p>The environment and the method that was chosen to provide us with feedback was frustrating at best, but I'm glad that I stayed because some people managed to find some errors. I also received some feedback on things that I would have ignored otherwise, because it isn't against the requirements nor do I want to find out how to fix it. I gathered all the feedback, made a list of it, and separated the feedback into three categories: one for taste, one for vague feedback, and one with the highest priority to implement.</p>
    <h3>taste</h3>
    <ul>
        <il></il>
        <il></il>
        <il></il>
        <il></il>
        <il></il>
    </ul>
    <h3>vague</h3>
    <ul>
        <il></il>
        <il></il>
        <il></il>
        <il></il>
        <il></il>
    </ul>
    <h3>high priority</h3>
    <ul>
        <il></il>
        <il></il>
        <il></il>
        <il></il>
        <il></il>
    </ul>
