        <p>As part of my study choice activities, I visited the HZ open day. I explored several programs, including
            Chemistry, Civil Engineering, and IT. Out of these, I liked IT the most, so I asked my high school if I
            could
            attend a “study for a day” program. During that day, I felt that I could really see myself studying in this
            field. Afterward, I compared IT programs at different universities, but I liked the program at HZ the most,
            so I
            decided to focus on it. My high school offered more study choice activities, but I did not find them very
            helpful. Most of them where "this exist too" and "make this quize". The quizes where increabley unhelpful
            for me
            , cause while my pears where getting 80% match to a field, my top match was 30%.In the future, I would like
            to
            become a software engineer or an ethical hacker.</p>
