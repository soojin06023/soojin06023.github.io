    <h1>my study choice</h1>
    <p>As part of my study choice activities, I visited the HZ open day. I explored several programs, including
        Chemistry, Civil Engineering, and IT. Out of these, I liked IT the most, so I asked my high school if I could
        attend a “study for a day” program. During that day, I felt that I could really see myself studying in this
        field. Afterward, I compared IT programs at different universities, but I liked the program at HZ the most, so I
        decided to focus on it. My high school offered more study choice activities, but I did not find them very
        helpful. In the future, I would like to become a software engineer or an ethical hacker.</p>
