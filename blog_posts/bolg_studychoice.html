        <img class="catWithBook" src="../pics/catWithBook.jpeg" alt="a cat reading a book">
        <p>As part of my study choice activities, I visited the HZ open day. I explored several programs, including
            Chemistry, Civil Engineering, and IT. Out of these, I liked IT the most, so I asked my high school if I
            could
            attend a “study for a day” program. During that day, I felt that I could really see myself studying in this
            field. Afterward, I compared IT programs at different universities, but I liked the program at HZ the most,
            so I decided to go to it. Then i found out that i techincally could go to KIST wich is basically Korean MIT.
            so hz droped and became pland b.

        <p>I chose IT because I took an IT course in high school and really enjoyed it. That was my first real
            introduction to programming and problem-solving with computers, and I quickly realized that it suited me.
            Another reason IT feels like the right path is that it's the only STEM field I know where I don't have to
            study physics or chemistry—two subjects I've grown to dislike over time.<br>
            I'm also autistic, and I think IT is one of the few fields where that can actually be an advantage. I like
            that the work is structured, logical, and allows for deep focus. It's a space where I can solve problems in
            my own way, which makes me feel confident that I can grow both technically and professionally without
            constantly struggling against the difficulties I sometimes face in other environments.</p>
        <p>Afther the IT program I would like to become a software engineer or an ethical hacker. As a software engineer i woud like to make
            softwar to accomadate livng as a neurodivergent person. because I`m autistic, most of my friends are
            neurodivergent and the struggle is real. The ethical hacker is just cause it seems cool and I always like to
            have a back up option.</p>
