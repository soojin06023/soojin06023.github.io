        <h1>programming experience</h1>
        <p>In high school, I took a course called Informatica, which I chose at the end of my third year and continued
            for
            two years. Informatica is essentially computer science, and it gave me the opportunity to explore many areas
            of
            it. During the course, we worked with HTML and CSS to build websites, used Micro:bit to get experience
            with hardware and sensors, learned SQL for databases, and practiced programming in Python. We also covered
            important topics like cybersecurity and ethics and computer science basics like what hardware is. Out of
            everything we studied, I especially enjoyed Python. but it was all quite basic and i forgot nearly
            everything. So now i'm regreting not practising in my summer vaction. </p>
