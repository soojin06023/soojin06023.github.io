    <h1>Mararet Hamilton</h1>
    <p>Margaret Hamilton was a woman. Born in 1936, she lived through World War II and the Cold War, up until the
        present. She has seen the floppy disk come and go along with many other things. She could tell me so many interesting
        stories, which is what made me interested in writing about her. While looking her up, I found out that she
        actually studied math, which I rarely find amusing or interesting. So my faith in becoming like her plummeted.</br>
        But I continued reading.
