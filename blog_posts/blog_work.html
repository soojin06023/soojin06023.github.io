        <h1>Mararet Hamilton</h1>
        <p>Margaret Hamilton was a woman. Born in 1936, she lived through World War II and the Cold War, up until the
            present. She has seen the floppy disk come and go along with many other things. She could tell me so many
            interesting
            stories, which is what made me interested in writing about her. While looking her up, I found out that she
            actually studied math, which I rarely find amusing or interesting. So my faith in becoming like her
            plummeted. But I continued reading.

        </p>
        <h4>Before</h4>
        <p>So, she is an American. She was a great IT person and worked on getting people to the moon. But what did she
            do
            before that? <br>
            Although we call her a computer scientist, she actually studied math. She liked abstract math. Which I don't
            EVEN
            understand WHAT it is.<br> She first studied mathematics at the University of Michigan in 1955 before
            transferring
            to Earlham College, where her mother had been a student. She earned her BA there and then went on to study
            abstract mathematics at Brandeis University. You might think she would stay there and get a degree in
            abstract
            math. But no—she went to MIT to work for a
            meteorology professor.So that's how she ended up working on sending people to the moon. By now, you're
            probably
            wondering where the computer science part of all this is. Well, I was too. So hier is It. The computer
            science of it. while working for the meteorology professor, she developed a Soft-Ware that predicts weather.
            After that, but still at MIT Magaret Hamelton programmed some software for the US air force.
        </p>
        <h4>While</h4>
        <p>What did she do in the Apollo project? Was she that important?<br>
            Well, Yes. She was that important. She was the first programmer on the project. She made the software
            prioritize
            things, wich directly made it posible to continue the landing. She led the team that wrote and tested all
            the
            flight software for both the Command Module and the Lunar Module, making sure everything worked perfectly
            during
            the missions. She also created systems that could detect and fix errors automatically, which meant the
            astronauts could stay safe even when something went wrong. During the Apollo 11 mission, when the computer
            was
            overloaded with alarms, her software's smart recovery system kept it running instead of crashing. Because of
            that, the landing could continue. She also came up with ways to restart programs safely and make the system
            more
            reliable. Her “priority display” showed the astronauts the most important warnings first, helping them make
            the
            right decisions in critical moments. Thanks to her work, the Apollo software was extremely reliable and
            helped
            ensure the success of the Moon landing.
        </p>
        <h4>After</h4>
        <p>After the Apollo project she still did a lot of things. Some of things that I find interesting are the number
            of
            papers that she published. Also she Co-founded Higher Order Software (HOS), with the intention of developing
            new
            methods for error prevention and fault tolerance. Using the knowinge from the apollo project. An other thing
            that I found interesting is that she lead the HOS as a CEO, Because being a CEO is an other differnt
            profesion
            she got in to.
