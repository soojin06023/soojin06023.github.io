    <h1> S.W.O.T.</h1>
    <h3>strengths</h3>
    <p>One of my biggest strengths is curiosity. Whether it's programming an Arduino or diving into history, I like to
        know how things work. I also tend to be persistent — if I don't understand something right away, I'll keep
        digging until it makes sense. Another strength is honesty in communication. I prefer being clear and direct,
        even if it feels blunt, because it helps avoid misunderstandings.</p>
    <h3>weaknesses</h3>
    <p>At the same time, I know I struggle with collaboration. Group work doesn't always come naturally to me, and I
        sometimes overthink what others might mean in conversations. Picking up on social cues can be difficult, which
        makes me second-guess myself and sometimes stay quiet instead of speaking up. I can also be overly
        self-critical, replaying moments in my head instead of letting them go.</p>
    <h3>opportunities</h3>
    <p>Despite these challenges, I see many opportunities. I'm interested in software engineering, which gives me room
        to apply my problem-solving skills and creativity. I also have opportunities to grow in my social life — for
        example, I've been building closer connections with friends and I've been learning how to express what kind of
        support
        works for me. Being half-Korean also gives me a unique cultural perspective that I can use in both school and
        personal projects.</p>
    <h3>threats</h3>
    <p>The biggest threats I face are internal: anxiety, self-doubt, and perfectionism. These can hold me back from
        taking risks or fully enjoying the progress I make. There's also the risk of miscommunication in friendships and
        relationships, since I don't always interpret signals the same way others do. On top of that, external pressures
        like exams and school deadlines can add extra stress.</p>
